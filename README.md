Precision Agriculture in Pest Management

Precision agriculture has been identified as one of the most important approaches to provide food security and reduce the poverty rate of sub-saharan African countries with precision pest control being a major component of precision agriculture. This paper discusses the results of  a preliminary field study carried-out to ascertain the prevalence of pests as well as the current methods of pest control in Rice Farming fields across Anambra State Nigeria. Specifically, the paper discusses the implications of pests in rice farming activities around the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Campus, Anambra State of Nigeria.  Preliminary field studies reveal that pest damage accounts for major pre-harvest losses in rice production, thereby constituting a challenge to sustainable rice production and food security. Furthermore, studies reveal that current  pest control methods of passive a blind application of pesticides as farmers are increasingly looking for more economic/healthier approaches to pesticide application.
